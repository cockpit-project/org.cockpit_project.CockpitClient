# Cockpit Client

This is not the repository you're looking for.

This repository is a fork of [the Cockpit Client flathub repository](https://github.com/flathub/org.cockpit_project.CockpitClient).

It only exists so that our release automation can push branches to propose to the other repository.

There's nothing else useful here to look at.
